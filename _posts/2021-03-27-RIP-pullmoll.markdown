Today, we were informed that our long time contributor and maintainer J端rgen
Buchm端ller (pullmoll) has passed away.

With boundless dedication, J端rgen was one of the most prolific contributors to
the Void project and sponsored the project financially, too.

He invested lots of his time in keeping gcc up to date, supplied tons of
patches to port packages to new compilers and platforms and also cared about
simple updates of packages.

He was not only a dedicated and driven developer in the Void Linux project, he
also was one of the friendliest and warmest person we had the pleasure to work
with. J端rgen will be missed as a steady force and a calm and wise voice in
discussions. Most of all, he will be remembered as a friend to all of us.

**Thank you, pullmoll.**

-- The Void Linux maintainers
