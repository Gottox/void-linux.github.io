Today we were informed that our long time contributor and maintainer Jürgen Buchmüller (pullmoll) passed away.
He was not only a dedicated and driven developer in the VoidLinux project, he also was one of the friendliest and warmest person we had the pleasure to work with. You will be missed as steady force, calm and wise voice in discussions, and first and foremost as a friend to all of us.

**Thank you pullmoll.**
