Today, we were informed that our long time contributor and maintainer J端rgen Buchm端ller (pullmoll) has passed away.

With boundless dedication, J端rgen was one of the most prolific contributors to the Void project.

He was not only a dedicated and driven developer in the Void Linux project, he also was one of the friendliest and warmest person we had the pleasure to work with. J端rgen will be missed as a steady force and a calm and wise voice in discussions. Most of all, he will be remembered as a friend to all of us.

**Thank you, pullmoll.**

-- The Void Linux maintainers
